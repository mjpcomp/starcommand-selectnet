# 🚀 starcommand

*Created By [Peter Azmy](https://github.com/clefspear)*

starcommand launches a different rocket every time you open a shell — a bash, zsh, PowerShell, and fish greeting that turns every new terminal into a unique generative artifact. Each rocket's colors, stars, and flame are mathematically linked — change the palette, and the entire constellation changes with it.

## Fork additions

*Modified by MJPComp (https://github.com/mjpcomp)*

This fork adds **network adapter selection** support for shells that display network information in the greeting.

### Network adapter selection

Supported shells:
- **PowerShell** (verified on Windows)
- **bash** (verified)
- **zsh** (implemented, not runtime-tested on Windows)
- **fish** (implemented, not runtime-tested on Windows)

New command:

```text
star net
star net list
star net use <interface>
star net auto
```

Behavior:
- `star net` shows the current setting (either a specific interface or `auto`)
- `star net list` lists available network interfaces
- `star net use <interface>` saves a preferred interface to the settings file
- `star net auto` clears the preference and returns to automatic detection

When a preferred interface is set, the greeting will query that interface for IP/gateway display first, then fall back to automatic detection if the interface is unavailable or returns no data.

Settings are persisted per shell:
- PowerShell: `~/.config/powershell/rocket_settings.ps1`
- bash: `~/.config/bash/rocket_settings.sh`
- zsh: `~/.config/zsh/rocket_settings.zsh`
- fish: `~/.config/fish/rocket_settings.fish`

> **Note:** bash changes were runtime-verified during development. PowerShell, zsh, and fish were updated with the same command structure and settings behavior, but zsh/fish specifically may benefit from validation on native Linux/macOS shell environments.

## How many rockets are possible?

A lot.

- **~2 × 10⁴³ unique rockets possible** — every palette deterministically reproducible from its six hex codes
- **148 candidate star cells** around the rocket
- **18 stars per rocket**, deterministically placed from the palette's bytes
- **8 flame patterns**, mapped from the first palette byte
- **28-color neon mode** that re-rolls every star color independently
- **6 color roles** (porthole, window, body, top, window-sides, flame), each drawn from a full 24-bit color space

<p align="center"><img src="docs/narrow.png"></p>

Every shell you open rolls a fresh palette from a high-entropy seed, so two identical rockets appearing twice in a lifetime is statistically impossible. Every tab is — visually — the first time anyone has ever seen that exact rocket.

But the kicker: it's all reproducible. Save a palette to favorites and you've saved the *entire visual identity*. Same six hex codes always produce the same 18 stars in the same 18 positions with the same flame. The palette is the spec.

*Every row is a rocket that actually rolled up in a normal week of opening tabs. Each palette deterministic from its six hex codes.*

## The `star` command

`star help` displays the current value of every setting inline, in **bold italics**, so you can see the active state at a glance.

|------------------|-------------------------------------------|
|`star`            |Save the current palette to favorites      |
|`star list`       |Show all favorites                         |
|`star remove N`   |Delete favorite `#N`                       |
|`star history`    |Last 20 palettes (most recent first)       |
|`star history N`  |Save palette `#N` from history to favorites|
|`star show H1..H6`|Preview a custom palette as a mini rocket  |
|`star add H1..H6 [H1..H6 ...]` |Add one or more palettes to favorites|
|`star explore [N]`|Browse `N` random palettes (default 5)     |
|`star supernova`  |Uninstall starcommand from this system     |

*`star show` previews any 6 hex codes as a full rocket before saving — useful for vibe-checking a palette you found.*

*With per-launch randomization, `star history` is the easiest way to rescue a rocket you liked: it appeared a few tabs ago, scroll back, find its number, save it.*

### Settings

|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
|`star color`                     |Show current palette + rocket preview            |
|`star color theme <dark\|light>`  |Match your terminal background; rocket is white by default, black on light terminals|
|`star color random <white\|neon>` |Star color on random rockets                     |
|`star color favorite <gold\|neon>`|Star color on favorite rockets                   |
|`star color reset`               |Restore defaults                                 |
|`star weight <0-100>`            |Ratio of favorites to random rockets (default 20)|

Light-mode terminal? Run this once so stars stay readable and the rocket appears black instead of white:

```sh
star color theme light
```

The rocket is white by default (`_rkt_terminal_theme=dark`). The alternate theme renders it black (`_rkt_terminal_theme=light`) so it stays visible on light terminals.

-----

## Cross-shell reproducibility

starcommand uses a portable xorshift32 PRNG, implemented identically in bash, zsh, PowerShell, and fish. The seeding is independent per launch (every new shell rolls its own seed from `/dev/urandom`, or `Get-Random` on Windows), so each tab gets a fresh rocket — but if you feed the *same* seed to any of the four implementations, you get byte-identical output.

That matters because the palette is the spec. Save a palette to favorites in bash, sync `rocket_favorites.txt` to another machine running PowerShell, and that same six-hex-code line produces the same 18 stars in the same 18 positions with the same flame. Favorites are portable across every supported shell.

Verified by `tests/parity_test.sh`, which runs all four shells against a fixed reference fixture and confirms zero bytes of difference.

## Install

Requires bash ≥ 3.2 (macOS default), zsh ≥ 5.0, PowerShell ≥ 5.1, or fish ≥ 3.0.

**bash:**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/mjpcomp/starcommand-selectnet/releases/download/v1.0.8/install.sh | bash
```

Open a new tab. Done.

> \* macOS note: the installer writes to both `~/.bashrc` and `~/.bash_profile` so login shells pick it up.

**zsh:**

```zsh
curl -fsSL https://github.com/mjpcomp/starcommand-selectnet/releases/download/v1.0.8/zsh_greeting.zsh | zsh
```

Open a new tab. Done.

**fish:**

```fish
mkdir -p ~/.config/fish/functions
curl -fSL -o ~/.config/fish/functions/fish_greeting.fish \
  https://github.com/mjpcomp/starcommand-selectnet/releases/download/v1.0.8/fish_greeting.fish
```

Open a new tab. Done.

**PowerShell:**

```powershell
iwr -useb https://github.com/mjpcomp/starcommand-selectnet/releases/download/v1.0.8/install.ps1 | iex
```

Open a new tab. Done.

> Windows users: if you hit *"running scripts is disabled on this system"*, run this once and then re-run the installer:
>
> ```powershell
> Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
> ```

The `-fSL` flags on curl matter: `-f` makes curl fail on HTTP errors instead of writing the error body to disk, `-S` shows the error message, and `-L` follows redirects. Without `-f`, a typo'd URL silently saves "404: Not Found" as your shell greeting and you'll see `command not found: 404:` on every new tab until you fix it.

### PowerShell network adapter selection

On systems with multiple adapters, PowerShell can be told which interface to use for the greeting's network display.

List available adapters:

```powershell
star net list
```

Save a preferred adapter by interface alias:

```powershell
star net use "Wi-Fi"
```

Return to automatic selection:

```powershell
star net auto
```

This preference is saved in `~/.config/powershell/rocket_settings.ps1`.

## Updating

Run `star update` to fetch the latest version from GitHub Releases. You will be prompted to confirm before any files are overwritten.

On the first run, starcommand will ask whether you want to enable weekly background update checks:

```
starcommand: Allow starcommand to check Github periodically for future updates? [Y/N]
```

The check only runs if you opt in. To override at any time, set `STARCOMMAND_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1` in your shell's environment:

- bash/zsh: add `export STARCOMMAND_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1` to `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`
- fish: add `set -gx STARCOMMAND_NO_UPDATE_CHECK 1` to `~/.config/fish/config.fish`
- PowerShell: add `$env:STARCOMMAND_NO_UPDATE_CHECK = '1'` to your `$PROFILE`

## Color modes

**Gold (default for favorites)** — when a saved favorite rolls up, the star field renders in bright Mario-star yellow.

<!-- ![gold](docs/gold.png) -->

**White** — every star renders in plain terminal white. Clean, minimal, no frills.

**Neon** — every star independently rolls from a 28-color palette spanning the full hue wheel at 15° increments. Maximum chromatic chaos.

<!-- ![neon](docs/neon.png) -->

Use neon on favorites to make them pop, or on random rolls to make every shell feel like a party.

-----

## The math

**Palette → rocket** (the visual layer):
Each palette hex code splits into 3 bytes (R, G, B), giving 18 bytes per rocket. Those bytes index into a precomputed list of 148 candidate cells around the rocket. Each byte contributes two stars (`byte % 148` and `(byte + 73) % 148`, deduplicated). The flame is simpler: `bytes[0] % 8` picks from 8 ASCII patterns. Reproducible from the palette alone — same six hex codes, same constellation, every time.

**Seed → palette** (the cross-shell layer):
A xorshift32 PRNG, implemented identically across all four shells, generates the palette from a seed. The PRNG state is a single 32-bit unsigned integer, advanced with the standard `x ^= x << 13; x ^= x >> 17; x ^= x << 5` step, with `& 0xFFFFFFFF` masking on shells that use signed 64-bit integers (bash, zsh). HSL-to-hex color conversion uses awk on Unix shells and PowerShell's native math, both producing identical hex output.

**Seed sourcing:**
Every shell launch reads a fresh 32-bit unsigned integer from `/dev/urandom` on bash, zsh, and fish, and from `Get-Random` on PowerShell. Zero is rejected (xorshift32 sticks at zero) and re-rolled. This means every tab is a new rocket, but if you explicitly pass the same seed to any of the four implementations, you get byte-identical output — which is what makes favorites portable across shells.

Verified by `tests/parity_test.sh` and `tests/prng_reference.txt` — every shell reproduces the reference fixture exactly when given the same seed, and the end-to-end test confirms byte-identical output across bash, zsh, PowerShell, and fish.

## Uninstall

Run `star supernova` to remove starcommand from your system. You'll be asked to confirm, and whether to keep your favorites and history.

Alternatively, remove the source lines manually per the shell-specific instructions below, then delete the config files.

**\*bash:**

```bash
for f in ~/.bashrc ~/.bash_profile; do
  [ -f "$f" ] && sed -i '/starcommand.sh/d; /# >>> starcommand >>>/,/# <<< starcommand <<</d' "$f"
done
rm -f ~/.config/bash/starcommand.sh ~/.config/bash/rocket_favorites.txt ~/.config/bash/rocket_history.txt ~/.config/bash/rocket_settings.sh
```

**\*zsh:**

```bash
sed -i '/zsh_greeting.zsh/d; /# >>> starcommand >>>/,/# <<< starcommand <<</d' ~/.zshrc
rm -f ~/.config/zsh/zsh_greeting.zsh ~/.config/zsh/rocket_favorites.txt ~/.config/zsh/rocket_history.txt ~/.config/zsh/rocket_settings.zsh
```

> \* macOS note: the `sed -i` syntax above is GNU sed (Linux, WSL, Git Bash). On macOS (BSD sed), add an empty string after `-i`: `sed -i '' '/pattern/d' file`.

**fish:**

```fish
rm -f ~/.config/fish/functions/fish_greeting.fish ~/.config/fish/rocket_favorites.txt ~/.config/fish/rocket_history.txt ~/.config/fish/rocket_settings.fish
```

**PowerShell:**

```powershell
$profilePath = $PROFILE.CurrentUserAllHosts
if (Test-Path $profilePath) {
    $content = Get-Content $profilePath -Raw
    $cleaned = [regex]::Replace($content, "(?s)\r?\n?# >>> starcommand >>>.*?# <<< starcommand <<<\r?\n?", '')
    Set-Content -Path $profilePath -Value $cleaned.TrimEnd()
}
$profileDir = Split-Path $PROFILE.CurrentUserAllHosts -Parent
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force (Join-Path $profileDir 'Scripts/starcommand') -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Remove-Item -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue -Path @(
    (Join-Path $profileDir 'rocket_favorites.txt'),
    (Join-Path $profileDir 'rocket_history.txt'),
    (Join-Path $profileDir 'rocket_settings.ps1')
)
```
